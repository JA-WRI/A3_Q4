                            <p>
                                Premium-quality dry food provides a well-balanced diet for adult dogs and may be mixed
                                with
                                water, broth or canned food.
                                Your dog may enjoy cottage cheese, cooked egg or fruits and vegetables, but these
                                additions
                                should not total more than ten percent of his daily food intake.<br>
                                Puppies should be fed a high-quality, brand-name puppy food (large breed puppy foods for
                                large breeds). Please limit "people food," however,
                                because it can result in vitamin and mineral imbalances, bone and teeth problems and may
                                cause very picky eating ha bits and obesity.
                                Clean, fresh water should be available at all times, and be sure to wash food and water
                                dishes frequently.
                            </p>

                                <li>Puppies eight to 12 weeks old need four meals a day</li>
                                <li>Feed puppies three to six months old three meals a day.</li>
                                <li>Feed puppies six months to one year two meals a day.</li>
                                <li>When your dog reaches his first birthday, one meal a day is usually enough.</li>
                                <li>For some dogs, including larger canines or those prone to bloat, it's better to feed
                                    two
                                    smaller meals.</li>

                            <p>Dogs need exercise to burn calories, stimulate their minds, and stay healthy. Individual
                                exercise needs vary based on breed or breed mix, sex, age and level of health.
                                Exercise also tends to help dogs avoid boredom, which can lead to destructive behaviors.
                                Supervised fun and games will satisfy many of your pet's instinctual urges to dig, herd,
                                chew, retrieve and chase.

                            <p>Help keep your dog clean and reduce shedding with frequent brushing. Check for fleas and
                                ticks daily during warm weather. Most dogs don't need to be bathed more than a few times
                                a
                                year.
                                Before bathing, comb or cut out all mats from the coat.
                                Carefully rinse all soap out of the coat, or the dirt will stick to soap residue.<br>
                                Daily inspections of your dog for fleas and ticks during the warm seasons are important.
                                Use
                                a flea comb to find and remove fleas.
                                There are several new methods of flea and tick control. Speak to your veterinarian about
                                these and other options.</p>

                            <p>Your pet needs a warm, quiet place to rest, away from all drafts and off the floor. A
                                training crate or dog bed is ideal, with a clean blanket
                                or pillow placed inside. Wash the dog's bedding often. If your dog will be spending a
                                lot of
                                time outdoors, be sure she has access to shade and plenty of cool water in hot weather,
                                and
                                a warm, dry,
                                covered shelter when it's cold.</p>
                        </li>

                        <li>
                            <h2>5. Training </h2>
                            <p>Very important to train your dog so they do not run rampid in your house. Remeber you are
                                their owner and you are held liable if your dog hurts others. You can take your dog to
                                professional
                                trainers or you can train them at home regularly. Have treats with you and a lot of
                                patients.
                                Soon enough your dog will learn to behave in public and also in your home.
